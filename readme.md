## stuff abt the game
all u need to do is run `main.py`!! it saves ur high score in `data.txt` too. if its a bit too hard, u can modify the rates or initial coins in `info.py`!!

## stuff abt the code
some neww stuffff that wasnt on the original i think  
**type hints**  
```py
# no type hints
def divide(n):
    return n / 2

# yes type hints
def divide(n: int) -> float:
    return n / 2
```  
w/ the mypy type checker extension it solves tiny bugss and gives autocomplete!!!!!
**#region stuff**  
```py
# region
...
# endregion
```
makes it easierr to hide stuff since `game.py` is so big

**why dont u use dicts and instead u use classes**  
i dont like them

**@derived stuff**  
in shortt, a fancy way to call a function which needs a function

**did u use ai to code this**  
only to search stuff up w/o having to click on a bunch of linkss  

a long time agooo i used ai to solve a problem i was very stuck on. it felt soo unsatisfying!! so i quit ever using it for stuff like that!
